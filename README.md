# Download-PokeAPI-Pokemon-Sprites
Self explanatory really it generates a script that downloads png files of pokemon sprites

Caution: This is largely untested so hi labrat... From my testing it seems to work on windows but i didn't test on linux.

I believe this won't be an issue because curl is a linux command too but idk if the -o parameter will play nice... but hey what you got to lose?
